<Warning>
  Infisical currently has confirmed support for SAML SSO authentication with
  Okta, Azure AD, and JumpCloud. We're expanding support for other IdPs in the
  coming months, so stay tuned and feel free to request a IdP at this
  [issue](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/issues/442).
</Warning>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via protocols like [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

To note, configuring SSO retains the end-to-end encrypted architecture of Infisical because we decouple the **authentication** and **decryption** steps. In all login with SSO implementations,
your IdP cannot and will not have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets.
